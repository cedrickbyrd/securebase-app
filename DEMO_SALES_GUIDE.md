## 🎤 Talking Points

**When sharing the demo:**

> "We have a live demo you can try right now - no signup required. It's pre-populated with sample data so you can see exactly how the portal works. Takes 5 minutes to explore."

**If they ask about limitations:**

> "It's read-only, so you can click around safely without changing anything. Think of it like a showroom car - you can sit in it, test the features, but you can't drive it off the lot. That's what the free trial is for."

**Transition to trial:**

> "The demo gives you a feel for the UI. When you're ready to see it work with YOUR infrastructure, start the free trial. We'll deploy everything in your AWS account in under 10 minutes."
