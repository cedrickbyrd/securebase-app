## 🛡️ Security Features at a Glance

### HTTP Security Headers

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Content-Security-Policy** | Restrictive CSP | Prevents XSS attacks |

| **Strict-Transport-Security** | max-age=31536000 | Forces HTTPS (1 year) |
| **Referrer-Policy** | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Controls referrer leakage |
| **Permissions-Policy** | Restrictive | Disables unnecessary APIs |
| **X-Environment** | demo | Identifies environment |

### Authentication & Rate Limiting

| Feature | Configuration | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Demo Credentials** | `demo / demo` | `src/mocks/mockAuth.js` |
| **Rate Limit** | 5 attempts | Client-side tracking |
| **Lockout Duration** | 60 seconds | Automatic reset |
| **Session Storage** | sessionStorage | Auto-clear on tab close |
| **Session Timeout** | 1 hour | Token expiry |
| **Error Messages** | Generic | No system internals exposed |

### Data Protection

| Protection | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Production Data** | ❌ None | All data is mock/synthetic |
| **Real Secrets** | ❌ None | No production API keys |

## 🔍 Testing Security

### Manual Tests

#### 1. Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://demo.securebase.io | grep -E "(Content-Security|X-Frame|Strict-Transport|X-Environment)"
```

**Expected output:**
```
content-security-policy: default-src 'self'; ...
x-frame-options: DENY
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
x-environment: demo
```

#### 2. Test Rate Limiting
```
1. Open https://demo.securebase.io
2. Try login with wrong password 5 times
3. On 6th attempt, should see: "Too many failed attempts. Please try again in 1 minute."
4. Wait 60 seconds
5. Should be able to try again
```

#### 3. Test HTTPS Enforcement
```bash
curl -I http://demo.securebase.io
```

**Expected:** Redirect to `https://` (301 or 308)

#### 4. Test security.txt
```bash
curl https://demo.securebase.io/.well-known/security.txt
```

**Expected:** Contact info, expiry date, canonical URL

## 📋 Common Security Questions

### Q: Is demo/demo safe to share publicly?
**A:** ✅ YES - These credentials:
- Don't grant access to any production systems
- Only show mock/fake data
- Are isolated from real infrastructure
- Are rate-limited to prevent abuse

### Q: Can someone steal data from the demo?
**A:** ❌ NO - There is no real data to steal:
- All data is synthetic (obviously fake names)
- No connection to production databases
- No real AWS resources accessible
- No actual customer information

### Q: What if someone brute forces the login?
**A:** 🛡️ PROTECTED - Rate limiting prevents this:
- Max 5 failed attempts per session
- 60-second lockout after exceeding limit
- Client-side tracking (resets on browser close)
- No backend to overwhelm

### Q: Is the demo environment compliant (SOC2/HIPAA)?
**A:** 🎭 N/A - Compliance applies to production:
- Demo is for evaluation only
- No real data = no compliance requirements
- Production environment is compliant
- See production docs for compliance details

### Q: Can the demo be used for penetration testing?
**A:** ✅ YES (with limits):
- Allowed: Security research on demo.securebase.io
- Allowed: Testing rate limiting, CSP, headers
- NOT allowed: DoS attacks
- NOT allowed: Testing production infrastructure
- Report findings to: demo-support@securebase.io

### Q: How often are dependencies updated?
**A:** 📅 Monthly security updates:
- npm audit run weekly
- Critical patches within 48 hours
- Major updates quarterly
- Dependabot enabled
