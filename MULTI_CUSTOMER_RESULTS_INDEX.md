## 🔴 Critical Issues (Unchanged from First Simulation)

Same 3 critical fixes still required:

1. **Email Format** (5 min fix)
   - Status: ✅ FIXED — `coalesce(email, "${prefix}+${key}@demo.securebase.tximhotep.com")` replaces old `.aws-internal` pattern
   - Impact: Account creation fails without this
   - Fix: Use customer email instead

2. **Account ID** (5 min fix)
   - Change: Make optional; let AWS assign
   - Impact: Customers can't pre-allocate AWS accounts
   - Fix: Remove requirement, capture auto-assigned ID

3. **Remote State** (10 min fix)
   - Change: Local → S3 + DynamoDB
   - Impact: Production deployments blocked
   - Fix: Uncomment backend config

**Good News:** These fixes work for 1, 2, or 100 customers!

## 🎓 What 2-Customer Test Teaches Us

### ✅ Architecture Strengths
- Multi-tier OU routing is effective
- Tier-specific policies work correctly
- Parallel deployment scales well
- Infrastructure costs stay flat
- Revenue model is validated

### ⚠️ Operational Gaps (Phase 2)
- Dashboard needs customer filtering
- Billing needs per-tenant metering
- Support needs customer context
- Compliance needs framework isolation

### 💡 Key Insights
1. **2x customers ≠ 2x cost** - Infrastructure is fixed
2. **Parallel deployment** - 8 min for 1 or 2 customers
3. **Margin expansion** - 79% → 85% with just 1 more customer
4. **Support scaling** - 1 person handles 2-3 customers
5. **Unit economics** - Profit per customer: $10K+
